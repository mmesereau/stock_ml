1/7/18 Update:

Created my first linear model.  This model ultimately has an R^2 of -0.87 for the MSFT data from Jan 3 2000 to Dec 8 2017.  This model has three parameters used to predict tomorrow's close: Today's close, Bollinger Differential and RSI.  This model was largely a failure because of the abysmal R^2.
